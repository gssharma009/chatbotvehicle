This vehicle runs on a battery
and uses electricity instead of
gasoline like traditional cars. Please
read this manual carefully before
operates di erently.
This vehicle is powered by electricity
and has two batteries. One battery,
located under the chassis, gives
power to drive the vehicle. The other
battery, a 12V car battery in the front
compartment, powers instruments,
lights, and control modules.
1. Charging the traction battery:
The HV battery in the car needs to
be charged using household
electricity or approved DC - DC
chargers. Make sure all wires,
sockets, and plugs can handle the
professional
electrician set up the charging
system. It must be grounded
correctly and have a main switch
and safety device.
2. High-voltage cable warning: The
orange cable in the car carries
high voltage. Do not touch it. Pay
close attention to warning signs
on parts with high voltage.
3. Entering ready mode: When you
open the door, the car switches to
high-voltage mode. Step on the
brake pedal to start driving.
4. Using high-voltage mode: Once
the car is in high-voltage mode
(doors open and car powered on),
it mainly uses the HV battery. It
can run lights and air conditioning
for a long time. The HV battery
also charges the 12V battery.
5. Winter driving tips: In winter,
the HV battery s performance
decreases when it s cold but
improves as it warms up. To take
care of the battery, avoid fast
starts and driving fast for a long
time in cold weather. Use the
heater smartly, plan your trip well,
and charge the car on time.
6. Vehicle data collection: The
equipment will retrieve vehicle
data as speci ed in GB T32960.3-
2016, including vehicle data, drive
motor data, extreme value data,
vehicle position data, alarm data,
voltage data of rechargeable

abnormal running data of your
vehicle on the background server
terminal equipment, our service
personnel may contact you. At
this time, we need your support
and cooperation to eliminate
possible hidden dangers in time
7. Safety during charging: It is
forbidden to use false grounding
equipment such as the grounding
and resistance reduction module,
which may cause potential safety
hazards of electric shock during

Safety of HV system
a. HV component safety: Avoid
touching exposed or damaged
orange HV cables.
b. High-voltage system: Water
The high-voltage system remains
generally safe in the following
Water in the footwell after a
rainstorm with the sunroof open.

water up to 300 mm.
Leakage of liquids in the trunk.
In these situations, there is no risk
of electric shock. However, there
is a possibility of other damage to
the vehicle.
Each HV component has a
attention to relevant warnings. To
avoid electric shock, do not touch
any EV components, HV cables
other connectors. Do not touch
any exposed or damaged orange
HV cables, otherwise you may be
exposed to a risk of electric
shock. Please read and follow
these warnings carefully to avoid
electric shock. Do not touch any
HV components or cables.

c. Avoid modi cations:
Do not take disassemble or
modify any electrical parts in the
vehicle. Modifying them could
lead to serious problems like short
circuits, res, or burns.
Improper execution of the work
poses a risk of re and serious
injury from electric shock caused
by the high-voltage system.
JSW MG MOTOR advises that
modi cations and maintenance
on the vehicle should only be
conducted by JSW MG authorised
service center. The high-voltage
system in your vehicle is self-
contained, ensuring safety as long
as no unauthorized work is done
on high-voltage electrical parts or
the chassis.
Emergency situation
a. Accident response:
If there s an accident and you have
time, turn o the vehicle s power,
set the parking brake, turn on
hazard lights, place a warning
triangle, and leave the vehicle.
Contact the JSW MG authorised
service centre right away. If there s
no time, like if there s a re or
strong burning smell, turn o the
vehicle and activate the parking
brake to get out.
b. Fire or smoke situation:
Immediately turn o the power
supply and get o the vehicle. If
the re is intensive or develops
rapidly, stay away from the vehicle
immediately and call 101. If the
re is not intensive, use a water-
based re extinguisher to put out
the re and keep a safe distance
from the re source.

This section of the manual, along with
others, contains crucial safety
guidelines.
precautions:
a. Always use your seat belt
It provides the best protection in
any type of accident. Airbags are
designed to complement seat
belts, not to replace them.
Therefore, even though your
vehicle has airbags, ALWAYS
passengers wear your seat belts
and wear them correctly.
b. Secure all children
All children under the age of 13
should ride in the back seat of your
restrained.
Infants and small children should
be secured in an appropriate Child
Restraint System. Older children
should use a booster seat with a
lap shoulder belt until they can
safely use the seat belt alone,
without the booster seat.
Do not use a cushion that reduces
friction between the seat and the
passenger. The passenger s hips may
slide under the lap portion of the seat
belt during an accident or a sudden
stop. Serious or fatal internal injuries
could result because the seat belt
cannot operate properly.
IMPORTANT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
c. Safety precautions
Adjusting the seats so that you
comfortable position plays an
important role for the safety of
the driver and passengers, as
much as seat belts and air bags
when in an accident.
d. Airbag risks
Though airbags can be life-saving,
they can also cause serious or
fatal injuries to those who are too
close or not properly restrained.
Infants, young children, and
shorter adults are especially at
risk. Adhere to all instructions
and warnings provided in this
manual regarding airbags.
Adjusting the seats so that you are
sitting in a safe and comfortable
position plays an important role
for the safety of the driver and
passengers, as much as seat belts
and air bags when in an accident.
e. Avoid driver distraction
Driver distraction is a signi cant
and potentially fatal hazard,
particularly for inexperienced
drivers. Always prioritize safety
and be aware of distractions like
drowsiness, reaching for objects,
eating, grooming, interacting with
other passengers, and using
mobile phones. To minimize
distraction:
Set up mobile devices (e.g.,
navigation units) only when
your vehicle is parked or
Use mobile devices only when
permitted by laws and when it
is safe. Never text or email
while driving; many places
have laws against texting and
some also ban handheld
Do not let mobile device use
distract you from driving. It s
your responsibility to ensure
that both hands remain on the
wheel and your attention stays
on the road.
f. Maintain appropriate speed
Driving at excessive speeds is a
leading cause of accidents and
injuries. Higher speeds increase
the risk of severe consequences,
although serious injuries can also
occur at lower speeds. Always
drive at a safe speed for the current
conditions, regardless of posted
speed limits.
g. Ensure vehicle safety

Child restraint system (CRS)
The vehicle is not equipped with a
child seat. If you need one, a child
seat that is applicable to ISOFIX
general type can be selected. Child
seat can only be placed on the 2nd
row seat, because the front seat is not
equipped with an anchor bracket. The
statistical data of accidents show
that placing the child seat on the
second row seat can largely improve
the child safety.
A young child shall always use the
child seat. Never hold a baby in
your arms while riding in the
vehicle. Never allow a child to
stand or kneel on a seat or in the
luggage compartment when the
vehicle is running.
An un xed child seat may be
thrown out of the vehicle in case of
a collision or emergency stop,
causing personal injuries to the
driver and passengers. Be sure to
properly secure the child seat even
when it is not in use.

putting a child in the seat. If the
child is too small and the seat belt
cannot provide the best protection
for him her, please make sure that
a proper child seat is used to
provide safety protection.
The size and con guration range of
the child seat is very wide. Not all
child seats are applicable to your
vehicle due to the interior trim as
well as the seat shape and size. You
have responsibility to ensure that
the child seat installed matches
with your vehicle and that the seat
can be connected correctly to the
vehicle with its anchor system. If
the child seat does not match with
your vehicle size and the child body

4. R oof rail airbags (If equipped)
For all airbags, the letter AIRBAG is
marked on the trim panel or the label
near the opening where they are
deployed. For frontal air bags, the
letter AIRBAG for the driver is
located in the middle of the steering
wheel, and that for the front
instrument panel. For lateral-impact
air bags, the letter AIRBAG is
located on the backrest side, near to

lining or trim panel.
Safety precautions warnings
The cars have air bags for the driver
and front passenger seats. These air
bags help the seat belts protect you.
Always wear your seat belt when
driving. The front air bags are
designed to supplement the three-
point seat belts. For these air bags
to provide protection, the seat belts
must be always worn when driving.
You can be severely injured or killed
in an accident if you are not wearing
a seat belt. Air bags are designed to
supplement seat belts, but do not
replace them.
Airbags are not designed to deploy
in every collision. In some
accidents, the seat belts are the
only restraint protecting you.

Airbag safety tips
Always wear seat belts and use
Child Restraint Systems on every
trip. Even with air bags, you can get
seriously hurt or killed in a crash if
you re not properly belted or wearing
your seat belt when the air bag
in ates. Never put a child in a Child
Restraint System or booster seat in
the front passenger seat unless the
air bag is turned o . An in ating air
bag could hit the child and cause
serious or fatal injuries. ABC -
Always Buckle Children under age 13
in the back seat. It s the safest place
for kids of any age. If a child age 13
or older must sit in the front seat,
make sure they re properly belted
and move the seat as far back as it
can go. All passengers should sit
upright with their seat belt on, feet
on the oor, until the vehicle is
parked and turned o . If someone
isn t in the right position during a
crash, the air bag could hit them
hard and cause serious injuries.
You and your passengers should
avoid sitting too close to air bags or
leaning against the door or centre
Move your seat back as far as
possible from front air bags while
still being able to control the vehicle.
Airbag position marking:
As shown in the Figure A above, the
driver frontal airbag is located in the

When shall the airbag be in ated?
The frontal airbag is designed to be
in ated in moderate to severe head-
on collision or almost head-on
collision to reduce severe injury risks
passenger s head and chest.
Frontal airbag in ation is not
primarily dependent on the speed of
the vehicle, but on the object being
collided with, the direction of the
collision and the deceleration of the
vehicle per unit time during the
collision. The frontal airbag may be
in ated at di erent collision speed.
It depends on whether the vehicle
hits the object straight or at an angle
at the moment of the collision, and
on whether the collided object is
xed or moving, non- deformable or
deformable, narrow or wide. Due to
di erent designs of each model, the
collision in ation conditions of the
frontal airbag may vary. Frontal
airbags do not in ate in the event of
a vehicle rollover, a rear collision and
many side collisions. The frontal
airbag may not in ate in slight head-
on or nearly head-on collisions,
collisions,
collisions to cylindrical objects
(such as telegraph pole and tree
trunk), rear-end collisions under
large vehicle (trucks, etc.) breast
board and lateral glancing collisions.
As per the design, the seat lateral-
impact airbag and the side curtain
airbag will in ate according to the
impact position in case of the
moderate to severe lateral collisions.
The seat lateral-impact airbag and
the side curtain airbag will not be

collisions. The seat lateral-impact
airbag and the side curtain airbag
may not in ate in slight side
collisions and lateral-frontal or
diagonal collisions. As per the
design, the seat lateral-impact

professional
How is the airbag in ated? During
in ation, the sensing system sends
an electronic signal that triggers the
gas generator to release gas to ll
the airbag, causing the airbag to
in ate and eject from the cover. The
gas generator, airbag and relevant
members are all components of the
airbag module. Please refer to
Airbag Position for details.
How does the airbag provide
protection? The airbags supplement
the protection provided by the seat
belts by distributing the impact
collisions where the occupant s
body is not moving in the direction of
the airbag, and in collisions where
an external object has entered the
vehicle, the airbag is unable to
provide the appropriate protection.
The airbag shall only be seen as a
supplementary device to the seat
When the airbag is in ated, dust
may be spread in the air. All persons
in the vehicle shall get o the
vehicle as soon as possible. If you
have a breathing problem and
cannot get o the vehicle after
airbag in ation, open the windows
or doors to get fresh air. If breathing
problems occur after the airbag is
in ated, you should seek medical
attention as soon as possible.

What will you see after the airbag
in ates? When the airbag is in ated,
it will de ate so quickly that some
people may not even notice that the
airbag has been in ated because it
de ates so fast. Smoke and dust
may also be emitted from the
de ated airbag vent. If the vehicle

The Electronic Stability Control
(ESC) system is an advanced safety
feature that builds on the functions
of ABS and TCS. It includes sensors
like the yaw rate sensor, lateral
acceleration sensor, and steering
wheel angle sensor. These sensors
help monitor and control the driving
and braking forces of all wheels-
front, rear, left, and right-through a
computer (ECU). This ensures the
vehicle stays stable during turns and
manoeuvres. If the driver pushes the
limits, especially during high-speed
turns, the ESC system steps in
automatically to regain control and
keep the vehicle safe.
Indicators relevant to the ESC
system consist of ABS MIL, EBD MIL,
ESC MIL and ESC OFF indicator.

vehicle needs charging
recommended that you charge
the vehicle when parking it.
Shallow charge and discharge is
conducive to prolonging the
battery life. Do not wait until the
recharging, which may not be
conducive to your next trip and
the battery life.
2. If the SOC low warning light goes
on during driving, it indicates that
the traction battery pack is low
and needs to be charged as soon
as possible.

Requirements for charging power
The charging system for the (360km)
model has a rated power of 3.3KW.
The charging power is dependent on
the speci cations of the charging
gun charging pile and can be used
with a standard household 220V AC
power supply.
If there is a di erence between
the external power supply power
and the charging machine s rated
power, the charging power is
consistent with the smaller one.

cardiac pacemaker in a person.
When a person has an implant
like the one mentioned above,
make sure to ask the medical
team and the manufacturer
whether charging your EV will
impact the operation of the
medical electric device implant.
In such case, do not go near the
vehicle when it is charging.
Ensure that the charging gun is
always stored in a safe place. Do
not expose it to rain or wet
conditions. Avoid pouring or
dripping water or other liquids
over it. If water penetrates the
electrical devices, the risk of
electric shock increases. Ensure
that all plugs and cables are free
of moisture before using the
charging gun. Never connect the
charging gun to the mains with
wet or moist hands or when the
charging gun is wet.

Jump Starting (Dead Battery)
If you cannot unlock the vehicle with
the remote control or if nothing
appears on the instrument cluster,
the 12V battery might be low.
In this situation, you can use another
vehicle s 12V battery to jump start
your vehicle, unless you are con dent
in your electrical knowledge and can
do it safely.
Before Jump Starting:
1. Place the vehicles close enough so
the jumper cables can reach but
ensure that their body parts do not

Always ensure that the battery
cover and cables are securely
tightened after completing the
jump start. Failure to do so
could damage parts, cause
noise issues, or allow foreign
substances to enter.
Towing the Vehicle
If emergency towing is required, we
recommend having it performed by
an authorized JSW MG RSA partner or
a professional tow-truck service.
Recommended Towing
If your vehicle breaks down, we
recommend towing it with the driving
wheels o the ground or placing it on
a atbed truck, as illustrated.
Proper lifting and towing methods
are crucial to avoid damaging the
vehicle. Using wheel dollies or a
atbed is highly recommended.
Improperly disposing of a battery
can harm the environment and
human health. Follow your local
laws or regulations for proper
battery disposal.

Lamp Fogging
When the headlamp is on, a large
amount of heat will be generated,
which needs to be dissipated
through the vent hole on the lamp,
so the lamp is not completely
sealed, and humid air can enter the
lamp through the vent hole. When
the temperature in the lamp is
obviously higher than the ambient
temperature or the ambient humidity
is high, for example, in cold or humid
weather, or when the vehicle is
running in rain, or after it is washed,
the water vapor inside the lamp will
condense on the surface of the lamp
cover, resulting in water mist (similar
to the fogging phenomenon of the
window glass). It is normal that the
lighting function and the service life
of headlamps will not be a ected.
Park the vehicle in a dry, ventilated
area and the moisture will gradually
dissipate. The water mist dissipates
faster when the vehicle is driving
with lamps on or exposed to
